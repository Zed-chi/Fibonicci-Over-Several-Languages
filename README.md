# Fibonicci-Over-Several-Languages
Just trying to do some same things with languages i know (or not)
Currently im digging:
* JS(node)
* Python / PyPy
* Dart
* PHP
* Go
* C (maybe D too)
* Java

## Thoughts
Its all about doing simple tasks, 
but main willing to choose language 
with better syntax and better time.

## Tasks
* CPU task
* File IO
* Web IO
* Console Print Results

### CPU task
simple Fibonacci

### File IO task
* Maybe Process Pic
* Maybe Find or count Some Info from json in provided txt File.
* save time results in other txt.

### Web IO
* Maybe Dowload Pic To process
* JSON
